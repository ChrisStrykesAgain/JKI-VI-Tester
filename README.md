# JKI VI Tester for LabVIEW

![2017-04-29_10-50-13](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/381432/25557598/a56f55a2-2cc9-11e7-872d-9a1648e82a8a.png)

VI Tester is a software test framework for LabVIEW by [JKI](http://jki.net) that allows software developers to test their LabVIEW code (VIs). Software testing is a critical component of agile development and test driven development processes and is also critical for validating software functionality. VI Tester is based on the industry standard [xUnit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XUnit) software test architecture that is used in many other programming languages. This architecture is very flexible and powerful, but also very easy for beginners to learn.

About VI Tester
---------------
VI Tester is a software test framework for LabVIEW that allows software developers to test their LabVIEW code (VIs). Software testing is a critical component of [Agile development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) & [Test Driven development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) processes and is also critical for validating software functionality. VI Tester is based on the industry standard [xUnit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XUnit) software test architecture that is used in many other programming languages -- this architecture is very flexible and powerful, but also very easy for beginners to learn.

*Important: VI Tester is not a tool for testing hardware -- use [NI TestStand](http://www.ni.com/teststand/) for that.*

The VI Tester framework is composed of three parts:

- **Unit Tests** that you write to test your software application -- a unit test is just a VI that you write to test another VI
- **Graphical User Interface** for running tests -- a.k.a the "Graphical Test Runner"
- **Object-oriented Test Framework** -- the core architecture of the test framework

A few great videos from Fabiola De La Cueva on how to use VI Tester:

- [JKI VITester Demo1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ec1GOY_Cgxc) - This Video shows how a new test case using JKI VI tester is created to compare the output of a VI with the expected results.
- [JKI VITester Demo2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYPlYCnSLYo) - This Video shows how to test a method from a class using JKI VI Tester.
- [JKI VITester Demo3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfVnYtBEqAE) - This Video shows how to a test a range of values.

## System Requirements ##
VI Tester requires the following software:

- LabVIEW 2011 or greater on any operating system
